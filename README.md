### 🔹 Dashboard Sections Overview  

#### 1️⃣ Points & Progress Tracking  
- Displays the child's **current points** and **highest earned badge**, with icons for easy recognition.  
- Shows progress for:  
  - 📅 **Weekly completed chores**  
  - ☀️ **Today’s completed tasks**  
  - 🏆 **Achievements and challenge goals** with clear status indicators.  
- Points labels and icons are automatically sourced from the integration.  

---

#### 2️⃣ Chores Section  
- Chores are **automatically categorized** into:  
  - 🛑 **Overdue** — Chores past their due date  
  - ☀️ **Due this Morning** — Chores due before noon  
  - 🌞 **Due Today** — Chores due between noon and midnight  
  - 🗓️ **Upcoming & Bonus** — Future chores or those without a set date
  - 🏷️ **Custom Labels** — Create and assign labels in the integration to **group, filter, or exclude chores** based on category, difficulty, or any custom criteria.  

- Each chore card displays:  
  - 💎 **Points earned**  
  - 🔥 **Streak count**  
  - 📅 **Due date and time**  
  - 📌 **Status:** Pending, Approved, or Claimed  
- Shared chores are clearly marked with **“(S)”** for easy identification.  When one child claims a shared chore, the dashboard visually updates for the other assigned kids by displaying a purple icon and a multi-person symbol, indicating that someone else has already completed it. However, this is purely for awareness—each child's chore responsibility remains independently handled in the backend system. Their task can still become overdue if unclaimed, and they can still claim and get approval for completing it. While single-completion shared chores aren't currently supported, this visual indicator can serve as a helpful workaround for families managing shared tasks.

- Multi-claim chores now display in blue after their first approval. These chores also show an "(M)" after their status, indicating they can be claimed again.

# 🔧 How to Implement This Dashboard
Follow these steps to quickly set up the **KidsChores Dashboard** in Home Assistant, including both the **Kids** and **Parent** sections.  

This approach creates a **complete dashboard** in one step. Once it’s set up, you can:  
- 📌 **Move individual cards** to different positions or dashboards.  
- 🛠️ **Customize the layout** to suit your needs.  
- 📝 **Extract specific sections** from the dashboard YAML if you prefer to use them individually or in other dashboards.  

If you’re comfortable working with YAML, you can review the dashboard code to **select and reuse any individual cards or sections** that fit your needs.  
---

## 📌 Step 1: Install Custom Cards  
This dashboard requires **custom frontend cards** to function correctly.

1. **Open Home Assistant**
2. **Go to HACS → Frontend**
3. **Search and install the following cards:**
   - 🟢 **Mushroom Cards** (`custom:mushroom-template-card`)
   - 🟢 **Auto-Entities** (`custom:auto-entities`)
   - 🟢 **Mini Graph Card** (`custom:mini-graph-card`)
4. **Restart Home Assistant** to apply the changes.

---

## 📌 Step 2: Create a New Section Dashboard  
To keep the dashboard organized, create a **separate section for chore tracking**.  You can skip this step if you have an existing location you want to use.

1. **Go to Home Assistant → Settings → Dashboards**  
2. Click **"Create Dashboard"**  
3. **Enter a name** (e.g., `"Kids Chores"`)  
5. Click **"Save"**

---

## 📌 Step 3: Add the Dashboard YAML  

1. **Open your new dashboard.**  
2. Click **"Edit Dashboard" → "Manage Dashboard"**  
3. Click the **"Edit Pencil"** next to the view name and select **"Edit YAML"**  
4. **Copy and paste the correct Kids Chores Dashboard YAML** file into the view.

 <p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21fe22b0-26d8-4031-a1f9-005f10d4f2ad" width="40%">
</p>

### 🌍 **Selecting dashboard with the correct language**  
The dashboard files are available in multiple languages. Choose the correct file based on the **2-letter ISO language code** at the end of the filename:  

| Language  | File Name |
|-----------|----------------|
| 🇩🇰 Danish  | `kc_dashboard_da.yaml` |
| 🇩🇪 German  | `kc_dashboard_de.yaml` |
| 🇬🇧 English | `kc_dashboard_en.yaml` |
| 🇫🇮 Finnish | `kc_dashboard_fi.yaml` |
| 🇳🇱 Dutch   | `kc_dashboard_nl.yaml` |
| 🇫🇷 French   | `kc_dashboard_fr.yaml` |

📌 **Find the latest files here:**  
🔗 [KidsChores Dashboard YAML Files](https://github.com/ccpk1/kidschores-ha-dashboard/blob/main/files)  

## 📌 Step 4: Find and Replace "Kidname"  
Since this YAML uses a **placeholder name**, update it to match your child's name.

1. **Find and replace all instances of:**  
   - `Kidname` → (e.g., `"Payton"`)  
2. After you paste the YAML file in, **Press \<CTRL\> F** to bring up Find/Replace
3. Ensure **case-sensitive replacement** to avoid errors.  
4. Click **"Save"** to apply changes.  

 <p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9413ff96-02a5-453b-bb17-c4a4eed758e4" width="40%">
</p>

Note - No longer required to change the "points" text, the new dashboard dynamically grabs the point label from the integration.

---

## 📌 Step 5: Add Required Helpers (UI Support)  
Currently, the KidsChores Dashboard requires a single **datetime helper** to support interactive features in the UI.

You will need to add:  
- 🗓️ **input_datetime.kc_ui_set_date_helper** — For setting custom due dates from the dashboard. The name of the entity is critical, so enter it carefully.  To add a helper, go to Settings \ Devices & Services \ Helpers then select "+ CREATE HELPER" and choose "Date and/or time"

 <p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a587f4d2-5875-4ff7-a69e-14d7ee1a7f5f" width="40%">
</p>

An **optional** automation can be added to continuously set the date of the date of that helper to tomorrow at 11PM.  Without this automation, the datetime will remain at whatever was last selected, which is not an issue.
- ⚙️ **Automation: kc_ui_set_date_on_hold** — .  

📄 [**kc-dashboard-uihelpers.yaml**](https://github.com/ccpk1/kidschores-ha-dashboard/blob/main/files/kc-dashboard-uihelpers.yaml)  

---

## 🎯 Finalizing the Dashboard  
- 🚀 **Exit edit mode** and test the new chore tracking system!  
- ✅ Ensure **buttons update chore statuses correctly.**  
- 🛠 If any entities are missing, check **sensor and button names** in Developer Tools → States.  

---

## 🎨 **Want Even More Customization?**  

The **KidsChores Dashboard** is designed to be **fully dynamic**, offering a rich feature set that works right out of the box. For most users, the default layout will be more than enough, but if you want to **tailor it further**, anythings possible:  

✅ **Move Cards to Other Dashboard Pages** – Reorganize components to fit your layout preferences.

The flexibility is built-in, allowing you to make it **as custom as you want** without breaking core functionality! 🚀  

---

### 🖥️ **Built-in Easily Adjust Column Width for Chores, Rewards, and Approvals**  

The column layout for **chores, rewards, and approvals** can now be adjusted in the **preferences**, allowing for a **customizable display**. Whether you're using a **phone, tablet, or larger screen**, you can configure it to show **a single column for compact views** or **multiple columns for a broader layout**.  

📌 **Note:** Column width settings may require adjustments to **UI layout settings** to ensure proper display on wider screens.

## 🚨 **Known Issues & Workarounds**  

### 🔹 **Renaming Chores and Rewards**  
While renaming chores and rewards works correctly **within the KidsChores integration**, it does **not** update the **entity names**, which the dashboard relies on to match the **friendly_name**.  

#### **Recommended Workaround:**  
✔ **Best Option:** Delete the chore or reward and **recreate it with the new name**.  

✔ **Manual Fix:** If you prefer to keep the existing entity, you can manually rename **all associated button and sensor entities** to match the new friendly name.  
  - However, **you must account for Home Assistant's special character handling**.  
  - **Accent characters are automatically normalized** (e.g., `"Štěpán"` → `"stepan"`).  
  - Spaces and special characters are replaced with **underscores (`_`)**.  
  - **Duplicate and trailing underscores are removed**.  
  - Example:  
    - `"Brush Teeth (Morning)"` becomes `"_brush_teeth_morning"`.  
    - `"Šimon’s Dishes!"` becomes `"_simons_dishes"`.  

If you experience issues after renaming a chore or reward, verify that the **entity names** match the expected format based on **Home Assistant’s naming conventions**.
